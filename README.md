# Accept a Payment

Build a simple checkout form to collect payment details. Included are some basic
build and run scripts you can use to start up the application.

## Running the sample

1. Build the application

~~~
npm install
~~~

2. Run the application

~~~
npm start
~~~

3. Go to [http://localhost:3000/checkout](http://localhost:3000/checkout)

## API Keys

This code sample uses a public sample test API key. Donâ€™t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.

The "View details" link to see the PaymentIntent details in the Dashboard won't work until you use your own test [API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys).
